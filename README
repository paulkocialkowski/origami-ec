About
-----

The Origami Embedded Controller firmware (Origami-EC) is a flexible free
software embedded controller firmware implementation for 8051-based platforms.

Assumptions
-----------

Origami-EC aims at being flexible and supporting various different embedded
controllers platforms and devices, by clearly separating the common,
platform-specific and device-specific code.

However, it is assumed that target platforms are 8051-based. In particular, the
code is optimized for 8-bit processors.

Supported platforms
-------------------

Origami-EC was initially written with support for the KB9012 embedded
controller, designed and produced by ENE.

Supported devices
-----------------

Origami-EC was initially written with support for the G505s laptop, designed
by Compal and produced by Lenovo.
