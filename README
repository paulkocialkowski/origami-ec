# Origami-EC

## About

The Origami Embedded Controller firmware (Origami-EC) is a free software
embedded controller firmware implementation. It aims to provide fully-featured
support for a variety of embedded controller platforms, host platforms and
devices. Origami-EC covers aspects such as power management, buttons, LEDs,
battery charging, backlight and internal keyboards and touchpads.

Origami-EC is free software: it is released under the GNU GPL version 3 or
later.

The project initially supports platforms based on the 8051 CPU, but more
platforms might be added in the future through distinct codebases.

## Contributions

### Coding Style

The coding style of the code base is expected to be kept consistent across
the project. Changes made to the coding style have to be motivated and applied
to the whole code base.

### Change Proposal

Changes to the Origami-EC code base can be submitted and integrated to its
source tree after a code review process.

A Signed-Off-By line is required for each proposed change, as a way to approve
the Developer Certificate of Origin <https://developercertificate.org/>.

## Compatibility

Origami-EC aims at being flexible and supporting various different embedded
controllers platforms and devices, by clearly separating the common,
platform-specific and device-specific code.
