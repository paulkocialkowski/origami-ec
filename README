# Origami-EC

## About

The Origami Embedded Controller firmware (Origami-EC) is a free software
embedded controller firmware implementation. It aims to provide fully-featured
support for a variety of embedded controller platforms, host platforms and
devices. Origami-EC covers aspects such as power management, buttons, LEDs,
battery charging, backlight and internal keyboards and touchpads.

Origami-EC is free software: it is released under the GNU GPL version 3 or
later.

The project initially supports platforms based on the 8051 CPU, but more
platforms might be added in the future through distinct codebases.

Origami-EC is an affiliated project of the Embedded Freedom initiative.

The website for the project is located at:
<https://projects.embedded-freedom.org/origami-ec/>

## Assumptions

Origami-EC aims at being flexible and supporting various different embedded
controllers platforms and devices, by clearly separating the common,
platform-specific and device-specific code.

However, it is assumed that target platforms are 8051-based. In particular, the
code is optimized for 8-bit processors.

## Supported Devices

Origami-EC currently supports the following device(s):

* G505s (Lenovo)

Support for these devices is still work in progress: it is not ready for daily
use!

## Supported Platforms

Origami-EC currently supports the following platform(s):

* KB9012 (ENE)

## Contributions

### Coding Style

The coding style of the code base is expected to be kept consistent across
the project. Changes made to the coding style have to be motivated and applied
to the whole code base.

### Change Proposal

Changes to the Origami-EC code base can be submitted and integrated to its
source tree after a code review process.

These changes should be submitted as email-formatted git patches to
origami-ec@lists.embedded-freedom.org with the maintainers concerned by the
change added in copy. The code review then takes places publicly on the mailing
list.

A Signed-Off-By line is required for each proposed change, as a way to approve
the Developer Certificate of Origin <https://developercertificate.org/>.
