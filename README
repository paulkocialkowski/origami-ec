# Origami-EC

## About

The Origami Embedded Controller firmware (Origami-EC) is a flexible free
software embedded controller firmware implementation for 8051-based platforms.

Origami-EC is an affiliated project of the Embedded Freedom initiative.

The website for the project is located at:
<https://projects.embedded-freedom.org/origami-ec/>

## Assumptions

Origami-EC aims at being flexible and supporting various different embedded
controllers platforms and devices, by clearly separating the common,
platform-specific and device-specific code.

However, it is assumed that target platforms are 8051-based. In particular, the
code is optimized for 8-bit processors.

## Supported platforms

Origami-EC was initially written with support for the KB9012 embedded
controller, designed and produced by ENE.

## Supported devices

Origami-EC was initially written with support for the G505s laptop, designed
by Compal and produced by Lenovo.

## Contributions

### Coding Style

The coding style of the code base is expected to be kept consistent across
the project. Changes made to the coding style have to be motivated and applied
to the whole code base.

### Change Proposal

Changes to the Origami-EC code base can be submitted and integrated to its
source tree after a code review process.

These changes should be submitted as email-formatted git patches to
origami-ec@lists.embedded-freedom.org with the maintainers concerned by the
change added in copy. The code review then takes places publicly on the mailing
list.

A Signed-Off-By line is required for each proposed change, as a way to approve
the Developer Certificate of Origin <https://developercertificate.org/>.
